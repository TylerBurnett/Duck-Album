<p>Welcome to Web-Dev Software Development Environment for David Chen's
web development courses. This server contains tools for developing web
application using Node.js, Apache 2.4, Composer (to install Laravel), and
mysql-client.

<ul>
<li><p>The apache web server at the this URL...</p>

    <p><center><code>
       <a href="./"
          >https://<i>{user}</i>.elf.ict.griffith.edu.au/</a>
    </code></center></p>

    <p>refers to the "<code>~/html/</code>" directory of your environment's
    working home.  Hence the html file you are reading now resides in the
    file "<code>~/html/index.html</code>". </p>

    <p>You are free to create other files and directories under
    "<code>~/html/</code>" to house your web projects and exercises
    (in HTML, PHP or Laravel). </p>&nbsp;</li>

<li><p>Your Node.js Application should be created <b>outside</b> the Apache
    "<code>html</code>" sub-directory, and should use port 8888...<br>
    And as such become accessable at the URL...</p>

    <p><center><code>
       https://<i>{user}</i>.elf.ict.griffith.edu.au:8888/
    </code></center></p>

<li><p>To install the Laravel Software, run
    <p><center><code>
       composer global require laravel/installer

    project.  Do not rely on other simular information that can be found on the
    web.  </p></li>
