# Duck-Album
 A web based Flickr wrapper that allows you to explore the many image and types of ducks
 
 ## Why this?
 This was a piece of assesment for my course that required use to use Flickr and Jquery together to provide a image album. It was   essentially a very easy assigment for which I got 19.5/20 for.
