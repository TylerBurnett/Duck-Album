# Duck-Album
 A web based Flickr wrapper that allows you to explore the many image and types of ducks
 
 ## Why this?
 This was a piece of assesment for my course that required use to use Flickr API and Jquery together to provide a image album. In terms of design and constraints this assingment achieved 97% of the required criteria.
 
Personally, I'm not proud of this work, the interface is basic and I feel it does not meet the standards of general applications. There is also no structuring of the codebase in terms of classes or namespaces, neither is it implmented in a MVC structure.
Because of the constraints, time, and weighting of the assesment this was the resulting final product.
